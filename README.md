# 🚀 Retro Space Run

**Retro Space Run** is a modern–retro space-sim arcade game built in pure HTML5 Canvas + JS.  
You pilot a glowing magenta-and-cyan ship through waves of asteroids, drones, and turrets, upgrading weapons and dodging your way to the finish gate at the end of each sector.

The visual style is inspired by 1980s vector-scan arcade cabinets — reimagined with glowing modern tones and fast-paced bullet-hell gameplay.

## 🧭 Planned Roadmap
